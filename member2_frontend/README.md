# Member 2 - Frontend/API Integration

Work here on templates, static assets, and API integration for the Mini Feedback Board.

Initial scope implemented:
- `index.html` shows a form and renders the list by calling `/api/feedback`
- Client-side validation and error display

Suggested next tasks:
- Add optimistic UI updates and better error states
- Add a simple page for viewing a single feedback item
- Improve styling and accessibility
